title: GET Labs 2016
---

In organized health research, the "[architecture of participation](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/03/socialcivics-and-the-architecture-of-participation.html)" (to borrow a term from Tim O'Reilly) is still in its infancy. A great place to see early formations and imagine what's next, is GET Labs on April 25th at Harvard Medical School.

Research teams from 18 participatory studies from around the US will be there, inviting you to various analyses, from gut and nasal microbiomes to the chemicals in your pee.
